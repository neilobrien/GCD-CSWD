<p class="review"> as odd as it is to say to start, my daughter does not drink nor do i (or not supposed to)... so of course we went to the Guinness brewery while in Dublin! It was really really wonderful. SO much history, well told, beautifully presented. the view from the very top of Dublin is stunning, even in grey weather! The food we had was fantastic and, of course, I had to break my medical rule and have a pint! One can NOT go to Dublin and NOT go here
</p>
<p class="review"> Visited here Easter Saturday 2017, booked tickets online for 10.15 am slot , staff outside did not seem in control of the queues and one said go in one line , other said another line , very very busy , sent in like a herd of cattle and left to do your own thing , best bit was the pint at the top floor and the views. entrance cost 18 Euro each
</p>
<p class="review"> Interesting, huge, informative, tons of people, food, snacks,beer, not personal ... Gravity Bar is AMAZING! It's basically a 'follow the arrows" self guided tour with tremendous information. You could rush through it all in an hour or take your time. We are glad we did it for sure, the Gravity Bar has an amazing view of the Phoenix Park to the Aviva Stadium and so much more ... 360 degree bar that's a must do!
</p>
<p class="review"> A lot more history here than I expected. You're able to walk around at your own pace and the displays do a fantastic job explain the brewing process and history. I've heard lots of people complain about how busy it is, but I did not find it crowded or overwhelming at all. At the end of the self-guided tour you were given a Guinness and offered to learn how to properly pour a Guinness (which the guys in our group loved). Definitely recommend making a stop here.
</p>
<p class="review"> I didn't expect much from this if I'm honest, but I was pleasantly surprised about how interesting the tour was, I'd certainly recommend it for anyone visiting Dublin, it's worth visiting.
</p>
<p class="review"> Bit overpriced for a self guided tour but still fun and somewhat educational. Video, audio and text panels guide you trough the different stages of beer making. Covering the history of Guinness and it's impact on the Dublin and it's people. Most of the video material sounds like a marketing pitch but I still think it is unavoidable tourist attraction. At the end of the tour you are given a choice to change your ticket for a complementary pint of Guinness or you can be instructed how to craft your own pint. I suggest you take the latter, it is fun and you get a Guinness certificate as a memory. Afterwards, take your pint to a Gravity bar and enjoy the view of Dublin from high above. Check their website for advance booking to get a discount on the tickets. I suggest visiting in morning hours to avoid crowds.

I've never been a fan of Guinness, but after visiting and being taught how to drink it properly, (yes, there is a proper way to drink guineas) I now like Guinness! However, it definitely tastes better from Dublin than anywhere else on the planet!
